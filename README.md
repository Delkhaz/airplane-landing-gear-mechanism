four bar linkage. 

Added First Position equation derivations , along with free body diagram. 

Soon to come : 
  * plane gear where it hits the ground. 
    equation derivations for planes gear. 
  
  * matlab code/simulation.  --- Done
  
  * rederive equations if simulation show signs of inaccuracy.
  * project description/problem.   -- 90%

# Abstract
  * Gain an enhanced understanding of how four bar linkages behave and methods used to analyze the motion of four bar linkages. We applied our knowledge of four bar linkages in analyzing the landing gear of a airplane. Matlab was utilized to write code that simulates the movement of the landing gear coupled with plot of graph that shows the values of the angle of the coupler link to the angle of the input link as well as the angle of the ouput link to the angle of the input link.
