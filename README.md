# Abstract
  * Gain an enhanced understanding of how four bar linkages behave and methods used to analyze the motion of four bar linkages. We applied our knowledge of four bar linkages in analyzing the landing gear of a airplane. Matlab was utilized to write code that simulates the movement of the landing gear coupled with plot of graph that shows the values of the angle of the coupler link to the angle of the input link as well as the angle of the ouput link to the angle of the input link.
  
  
# Kinematic Diagrams
  * Kinematic Diagrams are utilized to analyze the types and number of links plus joints in the mechanism. The links are label l_1  to L_N, where N represent the total number of links in a mechanism. The joints are labeled in alphabetical letters starting at A. The ground joints are represented as Oj, where j represents the total number of grounded joints. Figure below depicts the Kinematic diagram of the landing gear.
